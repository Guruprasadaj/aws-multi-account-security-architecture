# AI Interaction Transcript

## Prompting Strategy

I used Claude (Anthropic) as my AI assistant for this architecture project. My approach:

**Initial Strategy:**
- Started with broad architectural requirements
- Requested production-grade outputs for each component
- Iterated when initial results were too generic or verbose

**Key Refinements:**
- Asked for "senior engineer level" quality when outputs looked AI-generated
- Requested human-readable, conversational tone instead of formal documentation style
- Emphasized practical tradeoffs over theoretical perfection

**Quality Control:**
- Validated all Mermaid diagrams in mermaid.live
- Reviewed Terraform for best practices and proper comments
- Ensured documentation matched appropriate audience (technical vs. executive)

The main learning: AI tools produce better results with specific, critical feedback rather than accepting first drafts.
